design principle:
none of the numbers of the game should be visualitzed by actual digits
instead use overlapping circles, spirals of varying density and size, shapes and gradients
the mechanics and intricacies of the system should become intuitive by experience
the player needs to try upgrade options and deduce how the different stats affect the system
