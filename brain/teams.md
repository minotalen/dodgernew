# dodger teams
two separate arcade machines with different color schemes (maybe just invert?) communicate so that the other machine always knows the score of the other team. the main menu shows these scores prominently (not as numbers but as a generative shape made up of circles)
player are recognized with fingerprint to ensure they only play for one team (you can switch once if you change your mind!) and to ensure they don't play more often than X times per day && X times an hour
the score of the last ten playsessions is factored into the next starting score so a lineup of skilled players can push the team score up.
The current score average (of last 10) of the opposing team influences the enemy velocity. Your current score average influences the dodger velocity.
Additionally the enemy types get unlocked corresponding to your teams and the opposing teams highscore.

!! After every game the player can invest the gained points into different stat change. (Skills/Upgrades)
