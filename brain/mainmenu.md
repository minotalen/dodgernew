## main menu
the main menu should be controlled by dodger. this way we can preserve boolean input and provide the player with an environment where they can practice the controls without pressure to survive.
there should be some floaty things (planets?) with auras (probably versions of regular enemies with different shape)
every aura corresponds with a different action that is triggered
the auras should recharge. in the settings submenu some boolean settings can be toggled.
"fanout toggle" - a harvested aura spreads out three orbital planets
                  if one of them is activated the main object takes the status of the child planet and fans the orbitals back in
