### dodger arcade machine

who gives a shit about android release, dodger should be a single arcade machine
the length of a cycle is determined by the song playing in the background
the machine should feature a single button, a turning handle on the side and a fingerprint sensor
during every cycle every player can only play a single life (if they scan their finger again they get denied access 'you have already lived your life this cycle, come back next cycle')
at the end of a cycle the handle can be turned to rewind the song, resulting in a fresh start with the new starting value.
